"100 Days of Code – A Journey to Master the Art of Programming in Daily Hourly Strides."
<br>
DAY-1 [26-11-2023]
<br>
On Day 1 of the 100 Days of Coding Challenge,
I delved into the fundamentals of version control, immersing myself in the world of Git and GitHub repositories. Navigating through commands, I grasped the art of tracking 
changes, creating branches, and syncing with the collaborative platform that is GitHub. The initial strides in this version control journey not only opened a gateway 
to organized code management but also marked a foundational step towards collaborative coding practices. Excitement brews for the forthcoming days, each promising 
new revelations and deeper insights into the intricate dance of code versioning.
<br>
i did some web-research,watched videos to get started with Github 
<br>
happyCoding!!

DAY-2[27-11-2023]
<br>
On Day 2 of the coding challenge, 
<br>
I immersed myself in the realm of JavaScript, absorbing foundational concepts and exploring diverse topics. From variables to functions, loops, and conditionals,
the day was an enriching tapestry of coding fundamentals. Despite the challenges, I embraced hands-on practice, attempting to code and solidify my understanding of 
this versatile language. As the screen echoed with lines of code, the journey through JavaScript's basics marked a pivotal step toward mastering the language.
Excitement brews for the coding possibilities that lie ahead. 

<br>
i had taken up a course  from begginer to intermediate level.
