"100 Days of Code – A Journey to Master the Art of Programming in Daily Hourly Strides."
<br>
DAY-1 [26-11-2023]
<br>
On Day 1 of the 100 Days of Coding Challenge,
<br>
<br>
I delved into the fundamentals of version control, immersing myself in the world of Git and GitHub repositories. Navigating through commands, I grasped the art of tracking changes, creating branches, and syncing with the collaborative platform that is GitHub. The initial strides in this version control journey not only opened a gateway to organized code management but also marked a foundational step towards collaborative coding practices. Excitement brews for the forthcoming days, each promising new revelations and deeper insights into the intricate dance of code versioning.

happyCoding!!
